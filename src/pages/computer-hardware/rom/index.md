## ROM

ROM stands for Read-only memory , it is a piece of hardware that usually stores hardware specific software called firmware.
Unlike RAM it is non-volatile meaning that it can retrieve data even after being powered down.It is difficult to change data in ROMs so they are usually applied when there is no expected need for updates eg. a router , a console cartridge, a calculator  and generally devices that are not expected to have hardware changes about them at all.This is a possible disadvantage in case there is need to fix a bug or security issue.
With constant technological evolution , Read-only Memory has become memory that is read-only in normal operation, but can still be reprogrammed later.This type of ROM is called EPROM and EEPROM.
